This project is a Python-based application designed to perform document retrieval using vector indexing and querying mechanisms. It leverages the llama_index library, which integrates with OpenAI's language models, to provide a sophisticated query engine for retrieving relevant documents from a specified directory.
## Key Features
Document Indexing: The application reads documents from a directory and creates a vector store index for efficient retrieval.

Query Processing: Users can input queries, and the application processes these queries to find the most relevant documents using vector-based searching.

Integration with OpenAI Models: It utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model to enhance query understanding and processing.

Dynamic Retrieval: The application supports dynamic retrieval where the number of top responses can be specified, enhancing flexibility in the search results.

Pretty Printing: Responses are formatted and displayed in a user-friendly manner, with an option to show the source of the response.
## Usage
The application is interactive and prompts the user to input a query. It then processes this query to retrieve and display the top relevant documents based on the content of the documents in the specified directory.
This project is suitable for developers or researchers interested in document retrieval systems, especially those looking to integrate advanced language models for enhanced query understanding and response accuracy.
